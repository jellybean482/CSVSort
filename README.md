## Java CSV Sorter

### Instructions

Create a simple application in the language of your choosing (preference for Java, HTML + Javascript, Python, or GoLang) <br>
The application should, at a minimum, do the following:<br>
1 Read a csv file with the following columns: Name, Address, Invoice Amount, Date of Sale<br>
2 Accept user input, either as a start parameter to the program or interactive in the application, to indicate which 
column to sort<br>
3 Using your own algorithm, don't use the sorting functions built into the language, provide a program that sorts the 
data by the given column<br>
4 Also allow sorting by two columns at once.<br>
<br>
Come to the interview prepared to discuss the program including how you performed the sort, alternate methods, and other general questions.<br>
<br>
Sample data:<br>
<br>
Name, Address, Invoice Amount, Date of Sale<br>
